### ESP BLE Provisioning Using ESP32
#### Embedded Software Intern Assignment - Nineti GmbH

### Introduction
This project involves implementing ESP BLE provisioning using the ESP-IDF framework. The goal was to enable Wi-Fi configuration on an ESP32 microcontroller via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). A mobile device, using the ESP BLE Provisioning app, sends Wi-Fi credentials to the ESP32, allowing it to connect to the Wi-Fi network.

### Hardware and Software Setup

**Hardware Used:**
- **ESP32 Microcontroller**: For BLE provisioning and Wi-Fi connection.
- **Smartphone**: For BLE connection using the ESP BLE Provisioning app.

**Software Used:**
- **ESP-IDF (Espressif IoT Development Framework)**: For writing and deploying the firmware.
- **GitHub**: For version control and project submission.
- **ESP BLE Provisioning App**: For configuring Wi-Fi credentials via BLE.

---

### Steps for Implementation

1. **Setting Up ESP32 for BLE Provisioning**
   - Initialize Non-Volatile Storage (NVS) to store Wi-Fi credentials.
   - Configure the ESP32 as a BLE server to allow smartphone connections via BLE.
   - Use the ESP BLE Provisioning app to send Wi-Fi credentials (SSID and password) to the ESP32.

   ```c
   void app_main() {
       esp_err_t ret = nvs_flash_init(); // Initialize NVS
       
       if (ret == ESP_ERR_NVS_NO_FREE_PAGES || ret == ESP_ERR_NVS_NEW_VERSION_FOUND) {
           ESP_ERROR_CHECK(nvs_flash_erase());
           ret = nvs_flash_init();
       }

       // Start BLE provisioning
       start_ble_provisioning();
   }

   void start_ble_provisioning() {
       esp_ble_prov_mgr_init();  // Initialize BLE Provisioning Manager
       esp_ble_prov_mgr_start_service();  // Start the BLE service

       // Connect to Wi-Fi once credentials are received
       esp_wifi_connect();
   }
   ```

2. **Provisioning via ESP BLE Provisioning App**
   - The ESP32 broadcasts its BLE service, and the smartphone connects using the ESP BLE Provisioning app.
   - Provide Wi-Fi credentials (SSID and password) via the app.
   - The ESP32 attempts to connect to the Wi-Fi network after receiving the credentials.

3. **Wi-Fi Connection**
   - After receiving the credentials, the ESP32 connects to the network and prints the connection status:

   ```
   [WiFi] Connecting to network: HomeWiFi
   [WiFi] Successfully connected! IP Address: 192.168.1.100
   ```

---

### Challenges and Troubleshooting
- **BLE Connection Timeout**: Initially, the BLE connection timed out due to incorrect app permissions. Adjusting the appâ€™s permissions resolved the issue.
- **Incorrect Wi-Fi Credentials**: The ESP32 retries connection when credentials are incorrect. Feedback was added to the smartphone for connection failures.

---

### Expected Results
- The ESP32 should successfully connect to Wi-Fi after BLE provisioning.
- Screenshots can demonstrate expected outputs.

---

### Conclusion
This project demonstrates successful BLE-based Wi-Fi provisioning using the ESP32. It allows for easy wireless configuration of the ESP32 without hardcoding Wi-Fi credentials, making it flexible and user-friendly.
